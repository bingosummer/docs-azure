### v1.2.1

**Release Date:** March 10 2017

Features included in this release:

* Azure SQL Database Service
    * Add a new config form **SQL Database Config**. It allows the operator to disable the developer from creating the SQL server. To do this, the operator needs to uncheck `Allow to Create Sql Server` and provide SQL Server credentials by using `Add` in **SQL Database Config**. Then, the developer only needs to specify the SQL server name in the module configuration.
    * Provide the database-level users instead of the server-level users as the credentials. Note, you will no longer get the credentials of the admin user.
    * Add Transparent Data Encryption support.
    * Additional `jdbcUrl` string property support.
        * Append more options `Encrypt=true;TrustServerCertificate=false;HostNameInCertificate=*.database.windows.net;loginTimeout=30` to keep consistent with Azure Portal.
        * Add `jdbcUrlForAuditingEnabled`. It should be used when auditing is enabled.
        * Fix the issue of the allowed IP in the temporary firewall rule.
